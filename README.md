    - For any new feature or part of the assignment, create a new branch based on the `dev branch. Use the following command: 
        ```bash 
        git checkout -b <feat_branch> dev
        ```
        **Notes:** Do change the `<feat_branch>` to a unique name based on what you are adding to the repo. 
    - Once your work is complete, create a pull request to merge your changes into the `dev` branch and contact @[KShiMin](https://github.com/KShiMin) to review and merge.
2. **Folder Structure:**
    - For each new part of the assignment, create a new folder to hold the relevant C files. This helps keep the repository organised and prevents clutter in the main directory.

    - Follow this format: 
        - `feat: Description of the feature`
        - `fix: Description of the bug fix`
        - `refactor: Description of the refactoring`
        - `docs: Description of documentation changes`
